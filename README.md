# NodeStatusReporting
BT Coding Evaluation 2017/18

## Compiling and Running
The code is in three files: `NodeStatusReporting.java`, `Notification.java`,
and `Status.java`. The code can be compiled using the following command
(from a Linux terminal):
    
`$ javac NodeStatusReporting.java`
    
and then run with:
    
`$ java NodeStatusReporting input.txt`
    
where `input.txt` is the text file containing the notifications.

For testing, the version of the Java Compiler used was `1.8.0_144`.
